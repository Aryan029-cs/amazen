ðŸš€Amazon Clone - Powered by HTML5 & CSS! ðŸ–¥

Building something from scratch is always exciting, and this time, I took on the challenge of creating on Amazon- inspired colone using just HTML5 & CSS! ðŸŽ¯
This project helped me sharpen my front-end development skills while gaining insights into layout structuring and UI/UX consistency. 

ðŸ”·Key Features
âœ…Header & Navigation Bar - Designed a navbar with categories, a search box. 
âœ…Product Sections - implemented grid- based product display similar to Amazon's homepage layout. 
âœ…Footer Design - Added a structured footer with links, policies, and contact info. 

ðŸ’¡Tech Stack:
ðŸ”´HTML5 - For structuring the entire layout. 
ðŸ”µCSS - For styling responsiveness, and hover effects. 

ðŸ”—Next Steps: I plan to integrate JavaScript for dynamic interactions and improve user experience!
